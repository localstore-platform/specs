# Competitive Analysis

## Global Competitors

- **Squarespace / Wix / Weebly:**
  - **Strengths:** Powerful, flexible, huge feature sets.
  - **Weaknesses:** Not tailored for restaurants. Complex UI. No integration with local VN/JP ecosystems. Pricing model is not optimized for small local businesses. Generic templates.

## Local Competitors

- **Vietnam:**
  - **iPOS / Sapo:** Primarily POS systems that have added a web component.
  - **Strengths:** Deep integration with their own hardware/software.
  - **Weaknesses:** Websites are often an afterthought, with poor design and limited customization.
- **Japan:**
  - **Tabelog / Gurunavi:** Primarily discovery and review platforms.
  - **Strengths:** Massive user base for discovery.
  - **Weaknesses:** The "websites" they provide are just enhanced listings, not standalone sites. Limited branding and control for the business owner.

## Our Advantage: Hyper-Localization

Our core advantage is building a product that is *of* the local culture, not just *for* it. We will win by integrating deeply with the payment, delivery, and social platforms that people in Vietnam and Japan use every day. Our design, language, and features will be tailored to their specific business needs.
