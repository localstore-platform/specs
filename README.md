# Local Store Platform

**AI-powered business intelligence platform** for Vietnamese restaurant operators. We help chain owners and skilled operators make data-driven business decisions through AI recommendations.

This repository contains all strategic planning, architecture, and design documents for the project.

## 🚀 What We Build

**We're not a menu builder—we're an AI business manager.** Menu creation and online ordering are data collection tools that feed our AI models to deliver actionable business recommendations.

### Our Customers (Equal Priority)

**Segment A:** Chain owners (3-10 locations) who lack TIME to manage all locations  
**Segment B:** Skilled operators (chefs/baristas) who lack BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE

**Unified Value Proposition:** "AI quản lý kinh doanh cho chủ quán không có thời gian hoặc kiến thức về kinh tế"

### Product Priorities

1. **AI Analytics Dashboard (80%)** - Core product delivering business insights
2. **Data Collection Tools (15%)** - Menu, ordering, POS integration
3. **Customer-Facing Tools (5%)** - Public storefronts, QR menus

**Market:** Vietnam only (Phases 1-3). Deep integrations with MoMo, ZaloPay, GrabFood, Zalo.
