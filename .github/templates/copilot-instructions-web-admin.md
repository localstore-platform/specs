# GitHub Copilot Instructions – Web-Admin Repository

This extends the global instructions from the [specs repository](https://github.com/localstore-platform/specs/blob/v1.1-specs/.github/copilot-instructions.md).

## Repository Context

- **Repository:** web-admin
- **Purpose:** Internal admin tool for LocalStore Platform operators (tenant management, monitoring)
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Status:** 🔴 LOW PRIORITY (internal tool, not customer-facing)
- **Spec Version:** v1.1-specs

## 🚀 "Continue Work" Trigger

When the user says **"continue work"**, **"tiếp tục"**, or **"next task"**:

### Step 1: Read Local Progress

Read `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md` in this repository to understand:

- Current sprint and focus
- Which stories are assigned to this repo
- Current status of each story (🔴 Not Started / 🟡 In Progress / ✅ Done)
- Any blockers or notes from previous session

### Step 2: Identify Next Task

From CURRENT_WORK.md:

1. If any story is 🟡 In Progress → continue that story
2. Otherwise, pick the first 🔴 Not Started story
3. If all stories are ✅ Done → report completion and suggest next sprint

### Step 3: Load Specifications

1. Check the "Spec References" section in CURRENT_WORK.md for the spec link
2. Fetch and read the relevant specification section
3. Note: Internal admin specs are TBD

### Step 4: Implement

1. Follow the spec exactly
2. Apply code standards from this file (see below)
3. Internal admin patterns (not customer-facing standards)

### Step 5: Update Progress

After implementation, **update `docs/CURRENT_WORK.md`**:

- Change story status from 🔴 to 🟡 (in progress) or ✅ (done)
- Add notes about what was implemented
- Add any blockers or follow-up items
- Update "Last Updated" timestamp

### Step 6: Git Workflow

1. Create/use feature branch: `feat/<story-description>`
2. Commit with conventional message
3. Run `npm run lint && npm run test`
4. Create PR when story is complete

### Step 7: Report

Tell the user:

- What story you worked on
- What was implemented
- Current status
- What's next

└── auth/                 # Admin authentication
```

---

## Code Standards

### Next.js Patterns

- Use App Router (`app/` directory)
- Server Components by default
- Route groups: `(auth)`, `(admin)`
- Use middleware for platform operator authentication

### Access Control

- Internal network only, not publicly accessible
- Separate auth from customer authentication
- Direct database queries for admin operations

---

## Git Workflow

**CRITICAL:** Follow `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`:

- Never commit directly to main branch
- Branch naming: `feat/<story-description>` (e.g., `feat/tenant-management`)
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create PR after commits

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** `api` repo for some endpoints (or direct DB access)
- **Deployment:** Internal network only
- **No dependency on:** `contracts` repo (internal tool)
