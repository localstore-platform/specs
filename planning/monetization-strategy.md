# Monetization Strategy

**Strategic Context:** AI-powered business intelligence platform for Vietnamese restaurant operators. Pricing reflects **value delivered (ROI)**, not just features. See [product-strategy-refined.md](./product-strategy-refined.md) and [target-market-clarification.md](./target-market-clarification.md).

**Market:** Vietnam only (Phases 1-3). All pricing in Vietnamese Dong (₫).

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Value-Based Pricing (Not Feature-Based)

**Old Thinking:** Charge for features (custom domain, unlimited items, templates)  
**New Thinking:** Charge for **business outcomes** (AI recommendations, profitability increase, waste reduction)

**Example:**
- Segment B (skilled operator): AI helps increase profit margin from 8% to 22% → saves ₫20M+/year → easily justifies ₫200k/month
- Segment A (chain): AI identifies underperforming location, suggests fixes → increases revenue 15% at that location (₫50M+/year) → easily justifies ₫500k-1.5M/month

### 2. Dual-Segment Pricing

**Segment A: Chain Owners (30% of customers)**
- Pricing: ₫500k-1.5M/month based on # locations
- Value driver: **Time savings** (can't manage all locations manually) + location-specific insights
- Comparison: Cheaper than hiring manager (₫10-15M/month salary)

**Segment B: Skilled Operators Lacking Business Knowledge (70% of customers)**
- Pricing: ₫200k-500k/month for single location
- Value driver: **AI business coaching** (profitability, pricing, inventory guidance)
- Comparison: Cheaper than hiring accountant (₫8-10M/month) or business consultant (₫20M/project)

### 3. No Transaction Fees

**Why:** Transaction fees misalign incentives. We want customers to succeed (sell more), not take a cut of their revenue.

**Alternative:** Pure SaaS subscription based on value delivered (AI recommendations, analytics).

### 4. Vietnamese Pricing Psychology

- All prices in VND (₫), never show USD
- Round numbers: ₫200,000 not ₫199,000 (Vietnamese prefer clean numbers)
- Monthly billing default (annual discount later)
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)
- Free trial: 30 days, no credit card required

---

## Tiered Pricing Model

### Free Tier ("Dùng Thử" - Trial)

**Target:** Testing the platform, very small operations  
**Price:** ₫0/month  
**Limits:** 1 location, 20 menu items, NO AI recommendations

**Features:**
- ✓ Basic dashboard (revenue, orders, top items)
- ✓ Manual sales entry
- ✓ Menu management (20 items max)
- ✓ Basic storefront with subdomain
- ✓ QR code generation
- ✗ **NO AI recommendations** (key upsell driver)
- ✗ NO multi-location support
- ✗ NO POS integration
- ✗ Platform branding displayed

**Upsell Path:**
- When they want AI guidance → Starter tier (₫200k)
- When they open location #2 → Growth tier (₫500k)
- After 30 days trial → "Upgrade to get AI recommendations"

**Purpose:** Lead generation and product validation. Not a profit center.

---

### Starter Tier ("AI Trợ Lý" - AI Assistant)

**Target:** **Segment B** - Skilled operators (chefs, baristas) lacking business knowledge  
**Price:** ₫200,000/month (~$8 USD)  
**Limits:** 1 location, unlimited items

**Features:**
- ✓ **Basic AI recommendations** (this is the key value)
  - Profitability analysis: "Món này giá vốn ₫35k, bán ₫50k - lời ít. Tăng giá lên ₫65k?"
  - Pricing guidance: "Quán bên cạnh bán ₫30k, bạn bán ₫25k. Cân nhắc tăng giá?"
  - Slow-moving items: "Món X ế ẩm 3 ngày rồi. Thử giảm giá 20%?"
  - Low stock alerts: "Phở bò sắp hết. Nhập thêm."
- ✓ Daily automated reports ("Hôm nay bán được gì?", "Món nào lời nhất?")
- ✓ Manual data entry OR POS integration
- ✓ Unlimited menu items
- ✓ Basic storefront (remove platform branding)
- ✓ 7-day revenue trend chart
- ✗ NO multi-location support (single location only)
- ✗ NO advanced AI (forecasting, dynamic pricing)

**Value Proposition:**
> "AI giúp bạn hiểu kinh doanh. Không cần MBA, không cần thuê kế toán."
> (AI helps you understand business. No need for MBA or hiring accountant.)

**ROI Justification:**
- **Compare to:** Hiring accountant (₫8-10M/month) or business consultant (₫20M/project)
- **Expected impact:** 10-15% profit margin improvement in 3 months
- **Example:** Restaurant doing ₫100M/month revenue, 8% margin (₫8M profit). AI improves to 18% margin (₫18M profit) → extra ₫10M/month profit → ₫200k subscription is 2% of new profit

**Upsell Path:**
- When they open location #2 → Growth tier (₫500k)
- When they want advanced AI → Growth tier (₫500k for power users)

---

### Growth Tier ("Phát Triển" - Growth)

**Target:** **Segment A** - Small chains (2-3 locations) OR **Segment B** expanding  
**Price:** ₫500,000/month (~$20 USD)  
**Limits:** Up to 3 locations, unlimited items

**Features:**
- ✓ **Everything in Starter tier**
- ✓ **Multi-location management**
  - Location selector
  - Per-location analytics
  - Cross-location performance comparison
- ✓ **AI recommendations for chains**
  - "Địa điểm A bán được nhiều [món] hơn 2 lần so với B. Nghiên cứu chiến lược?"
  - "Tồn kho tại địa điểm C cao gấp đôi trung bình chuỗi. Kiểm tra?"
  - Location-specific pricing suggestions
- ✓ POS integration (automated data collection)
- ✓ Custom domain support
- ✓ Weekly automated reports (email + Zalo)

> (Manage multiple locations easily. AI tells you which location needs improvement.)

**ROI Justification:**
- **Compare to:** Hiring operations manager (₫10-15M/month salary)
- **Expected impact:** 15% revenue increase at underperforming locations
- **Example:** 3-location chain, each doing ₫200M/month. One location underperforms by 30% (should do ₫260M). AI identifies issue → grows to ₫230M (+₫30M/month) → ₫500k subscription is 1.6% of new revenue

**Upsell Path:**
- When they grow to 4+ locations → Pro tier (₫1.5M)
- When they want advanced AI features → Pro tier

---

### Pro Tier ("Chuyên Nghiệp" - Professional)

**Target:** Larger chains (5-10 locations) OR high-revenue single locations  
**Price:** ₫1,500,000/month (~$60 USD)

- ✓ Priority support (response <2 hours)
- ✓ Custom integrations (delivery partners, POS systems)
- ✓ White-label option (remove all branding)
- ✓ Advanced API access
- ✓ Dedicated account manager

**Value Proposition (Segment A - Larger Chains):**
> "AI tối ưu hóa toàn bộ chuỗi. Tăng doanh thu 15-20%, giảm lãng phí 30%."
> (AI optimizes entire chain. Increase revenue 15-20%, reduce waste 30%.)

**Value Proposition (Segment B - Power Users):**
> "Học kinh doanh từ AI và chuyên gia. Mỗi tháng có buổi tư vấn 1-1."
> (Learn business from AI and expert. Monthly 1-on-1 consultant call.)

**ROI Justification:**
- **Compare to:** Hiring data analyst (₫15-20M/month) + business consultant (₫20M/project)
- **Expected impact:** 15-20% revenue increase + 30% waste reduction
- **Example:** 5-location chain, ₫1B/month total revenue, 10% margin (₫100M profit). AI improves to 18% margin (₫180M profit) → extra ₫80M/month profit → ₫1.5M subscription is 1.9% of new profit

---

## Churn Reduction Strategy

### Reasons Customers Might Churn

1. **Not seeing ROI** (AI recommendations not valuable)
   - Mitigation: Monthly check-ins, ensure they're logging data correctly
   - Offer: Free consultant call to review usage

2. **Too expensive** (price-sensitive)
   - Mitigation: Show ROI calculator ("You saved ₫5M last month, subscription is ₫200k")
   - Offer: Downgrade to lower tier (keep them in ecosystem)

3. **Going out of business** (restaurant closed)
   - Mitigation: None (unavoidable)
   - Track: Understand why (poor location? bad food? competition?)

4. **Competitor offers lower price**
   - Mitigation: Emphasize AI value (not just features)
   - Offer: Match price for loyal customers (>6 months)

### Retention Tactics

- **30-day check-in:** Email/call to ensure onboarding successful
- **60-day review:** Show ROI metrics ("You increased profit 12% last month")
- **90-day case study:** Ask to be featured (social proof)
- **Annual renewal bonus:** Extra month free for annual prepay

## Competitive Pricing Analysis

### Vietnamese Competitors

| Competitor | Price | Focus | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **KiotViet** | ₫600k-1.5M/month | POS system | We have AI, they don't |
| **Sapo** | ₫500k-2M/month | POS + e-commerce | We have AI + cheaper for single location |
| **Haravan** | ₫800k-3M/month | E-commerce | We have AI + F&B focus |
| **None** | - | AI business intelligence | **We're first to market** |

**Key Insight:** Competitors focus on transactions (POS, orders). We focus on **intelligence** (AI recommendations). Different value proposition = no direct competition.

---

## Pricing Objections & Responses

### "Too expensive, I can't afford ₫200k/month"

**Response:** "If our AI helps you increase profit by just ₫1M/month (very conservative), the ₫200k subscription pays for itself 5x over. Let's do a free trial and I'll show you the ROI."

### "I already have a POS system, why do I need this?"

**Response:** "Your POS tracks sales. We analyze sales and tell you WHAT to do. Example: POS shows you sold 100 phở today. We tell you 'raise phở price by ₫5k because competitors charge ₫10k more.' That's the difference."

### "I'm just a small shop, AI is for big chains"

**Response:** "Actually, small shops need AI MORE. Big chains can hire analysts. You can't afford ₫10M/month analyst. Our AI is your ₫200k/month analyst."

### "I don't understand technology/AI"

**Response:** "You don't need to. AI sends you simple messages in Vietnamese like 'Món X ế, thử giảm giá' (Item X slow, try discount). Just follow the suggestions. We also have monthly calls to teach you."

---

## Future Monetization Opportunities (Phase 3+)

### 1. Transaction Fees on Online Ordering (Phase 3)

- **5% commission** on orders placed through platform
- Only applies to Pro/Enterprise tiers (value-add, not primary revenue)
- Example: Restaurant processes ₫100M/month orders → ₫5M commission → significant revenue boost

### 2. Supplier Marketplace (Phase 4)

- Connect restaurants with ingredient suppliers
- **10% commission** on supplier transactions
- AI recommends: "Bạn cần 50kg gạo, nhà cung cấp X có giá tốt nhất"
- Win-win: restaurants save money, we earn commission

### 3. Financial Services (Phase 4)

- **Lending:** Offer working capital loans (partner with bank)
- **Insurance:** Business interruption insurance (partner with insurer)
- **We have the data:** Know which restaurants are profitable → lower risk lending

### 4. Premium Consulting Services (Phase 3)

- **₫5M/project:** Deep-dive business audit (3-day on-site)
- Target: Segment A (chains) wanting custom strategy
- Upsell from Pro tier monthly calls

---

## Summary: Why This Pricing Works

### 1. Clear Value Ladder
- Free → Starter (₫200k) → Growth (₫500k) → Pro (₫1.5M) → Enterprise (custom)
- Each tier solves a bigger problem, earns more revenue

### 2. Segment-Specific
- Starter tier perfect for Segment B (skilled operators)
- Growth/Pro tiers perfect for Segment A (chains)
- Both segments can find their fit

### 3. ROI-Justified
- Every tier shows clear ROI vs alternatives (hiring accountant, manager, analyst)
- Customers don't buy "features" - they buy **business outcomes**

### 4. Competitive Moat
- No Vietnamese competitor offers AI business intelligence
- We can charge premium because we're solving different problem

### 5. Scalable
- SaaS model with high gross margins (80%+)
- AI improves with more customers (data flywheel)
