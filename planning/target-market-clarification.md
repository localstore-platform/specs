# Target Market Clarification

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Decision  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for dual-segment strategy

> **For complete strategy details, see [product-strategy-refined.md](./product-strategy-refined.md)**

## Key Strategic Decision

**Both customer segments are EQUALLY important:**

### Segment A: Chain Owners (30% of TAM)

- **Problem:** "Không có thời gian" (no time) to manage multiple locations
- **Solution:** AI provides cross-location analytics and location-specific recommendations
- **Market:** ~50,000 chains (2+ locations)
- **Pricing:** ₫500k-1.5M/month

### Segment B: Skilled Operators Without Business Training (70% of TAM)

- **Problem:** "Thiếu kiến thức kinh tế" (lack business/economics knowledge)
- **Solution:** AI provides daily business coaching and profitability guidance
- **Market:** ~60,000 owner-operators
- **Pricing:** ₫200k-500k/month

### Unified Value Proposition

> **"AI quản lý kinh doanh cho chủ quán không có thời gian HOẶC kiến thức về kinh tế"**
>
> (AI business manager for owners without time OR business knowledge)

**Why This Works:**

- Same core technology (AI recommendations) solves different pain points
- Multi-location architecture serves chains AND supports single-location growth
- Cross-segment data improves AI for everyone

## Key Product & Marketing Implications

### Multi-Location Architecture

- **For Segment A:** Required from day 1 (3-10 locations)
- **For Segment B:** Growth path (most start with 1 location, expand to 2-3)
- **Design:** Don't position as "chains only" - it's for "anyone managing multiple stores"

### AI Recommendations (Core Value)

- **For Segment A:** Cross-location insights ("Location A sells 2x more than B")
- **For Segment B:** Profitability coaching ("This dish has 43% margin - too low")

### Marketing Messages

✅ **Inclusive:** "AI business manager for restaurant owners"  
❌ **Chain-Only:** "Manage your restaurant chain with AI"

### Pricing Strategy

- **Starter (₫200k):** Segment B single-location operators
- **Growth (₫500k):** Small chains OR expanding operators
- **Pro (₫1.5M):** Larger chains OR high-revenue single locations

> **For detailed pricing and monetization, see [monetization-strategy.md](./monetization-strategy.md)**

## Key Takeaway

**Both segments equally important.** Don't treat skilled operators as secondary - they represent 70% of Year 1 customers and provide valuable data diversity for AI training.

- Chains need AI because they lack **TIME** (too many locations)
- Skilled operators need AI because they lack **KNOWLEDGE** (no business training)
- Both solved by AI-powered business intelligence

### 3. Growth Path Connects Segments

Many Segment B customers (skilled operators) will become Segment A (chains) as they expand. Platform supports this journey.

### 4. Pricing Reflects Value, Not Just Features

- Starter (₫200k): AI guidance for non-business people
- Growth (₫500k): Multi-location OR advanced single-location
- Pro (₫1.5M): Enterprise chains OR power users

### 5. Marketing Must Be Inclusive

Don't say "for chains" - say "for restaurant owners who need AI." Let customers self-select into appropriate tier.

## Next Steps

**Completed:**

- ✅ Updated all strategic documents to emphasize both segments equally
- ✅ Added "Starter" tier (₫200k/month) specifically for Segment B
- ✅ Revised marketing copy to be inclusive (not chain-focused)

**Upcoming:**

- Design onboarding flow with early segmentation question

- Create educational content for skilled operators
- Track customer acquisition by segment (target: 30% chains, 70% operators)
